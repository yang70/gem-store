# Gem Store - An Exercise in Angular JS

by [Matthew Yang](http://matthewgyang.com)

## Description
This assignment follows along with the [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com) course [Shaping Up With Angular](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js/intro).  This course walks you through the construction of a 'Gem Store' using [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/).

This repo keeps track of the code created through following that course in order to recreate it in my own development environment.
